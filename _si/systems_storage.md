The foundation of a building is the most important part. Problems with the base cause instability higher up. In the same way, problems with the infrastructure of your prepress facility can cause huge problems further upstream. Oldham provides a complete line of workstations, servers, storage, networking and archiving solutions to keep your production facility operating at peak efficiency. We also provide the expertise to install and maintain your systems over the long run. What foundation is your prepress facility built on?
