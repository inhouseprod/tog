      <p>Oldham Graphic Supply was established in Springfield, IL in 1951 under the name of its founder&mdash;Arch Oldham. The initial focus was on printing supplies. As the company grew, prepress, pressroom, and bindery equipment became increasingly important aspects of the business. In recent years, industrial supplies and equipment, digital printing, wide format equipment, banner and display media along with toner and inks have been added to the mix. </p>

<p>In 1990 Oldham Graphic Supply purchased Lens and Camera, a Peoria-based company; in 1996 R Graphics of Rockford was acquired. In 2004 we added offices in St. Louis Missouri, and Dallas Texas. Over the next few years Oldham expanded into ink production and the wide format market with two acquisitions and opened an additional office in North Canton, Ohio. With these expansions and acquisitions, Oldham Graphic Supply expanded its area of coverage to include  Arkansas, Illinois,  Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin. With all these changes came an update to the company name, The Oldham Group.</p>

<p>To keep pace with rapid changes in the printing and publishing industry, Oldham formed our electronics division in 1989. Since that time, The Oldham Group has invested significantly in electronics technology, training, and service. As systems integrators, The Oldham Group offers its customers expert assistance with regard to automated workflow solutions, digital asset management, CTP output devices, color proofing, color management, workstations, servers, networking, raid solutions and backup solutions.</p>

<p>To meet the growing needs of the wide format market, Oldham created a wide format division in 2007. The division includes a growing group of knowledgeable sales consultants and technicians to help customers sort through the constant introduction of new equipment, media and software specfically for wide format. Oldham stocks banner and display materials in all its warehouses for fast order respnonse.</p>

<p>More recently, the company has expanded into general industrial supplies and equipment. The new products offer existing customers the opportunity to consolidate a wide variety of general supplies and equipment into a single order. New customers benefit from highly competitive pricing and Oldham's long experience with time sensitve distribution and ordering.</p>

<p>Since its beginning, Oldham Graphic Supply has made every effort to offer the best possible products and service; customer satisfaction is top priority. It is our belief that the strong customer and manufacturer relationships we maintain will enable us to move forward with the challenges and changes of the future. </p>
